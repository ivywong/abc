			<h2 id="earlyedu">Early Childhood Programs</h2>
			<p>Recognizing that long-term benefits are gained from intervening early in the lives of children living in poverty, the centerpiece of ABC is high-quality early childhood education.</p>

			<p>Young children in ABC's preschools and early intervention programs thrive in classrooms that are alive with joyful songs, purposeful activities, brilliant colors and tender moments. There are corners to explore, mysteries to solve, books to discover, paint to splatter, drums to bang, steps to conquer and towers to build... and rebuild.</p>

			<p>Each school has its own special focus, yet all are rooted in ABCls commitment to the principle that every child is entitled to the best possible start - one that is full of happiness, accomplishment and love.</p>

			<p>ABC's schools celebrate children in all their exquisite diversity by appreciating their unique contributions, encouraging their optimum development, honoring their shared humanity and treasuring their infinite potential.</p>

			<p>ABC's unique approach extends well beyond the individual child to embrace the whole family by providing the supportive services that each family member needs. Parents are integral to their children's success, treasured partners in all of ABC's programs.</p>

			<h2 id="youth">Youth Services</h2>
			<p>ABC's youth programs fill a critical gap for high-quality out-of-school services for New York City's school-aged children. Year-round engaging services have been specifically designed to reach children and adolescents who are overlooked by traditional youth programs and to meet the needs of boys and girls who are homeless, emotionally disturbed, have severe disabilities and are medically fragile. The primary goal of ABC's youth programs is to ensure that each and every one of our children knows the kinds of joyful experiences that most American youngsters take for granted. Children are filled to the brim with dignity and respect and discover inner strengths, innate talents and their own bright futures.</p>

			<h2 id="support">Housing and Family Support</h2>
			<p>ABC is dedicated to defending and strengthening needy families so that they ultimately emerge more invigorated and cohesive, responsible for themselves and to their communities.</p>

			<p>Families are given the tools that foster long-term stability through home-based case management, parenting classes, family counseling, advocacy, housing and entitlement assistance.</p>

			<p>While also responding to the immediate needs of the family, ABC's preventive services promote family strength through innovative strategies such as art therapy, parent support groups, parent-infant play groups, thematic monthly parent education workshops, young leaders groups, an intensive baby outreach program and an incentive program for teens that rewards school attendance, academic performance and program participation.</p>

			<h2 id="mentalhealth">Mental Health Services</h2>
			<p>ABC established New York City's first mobile mental health crisis and disaster team for children in 1996. Fast Break is a mobile mental health clinic that serves children who have not had access to traditional psychotherapeutic services.</p>

			<p>Headquartered at Echo Park, Fast Break helps children and families cope with severe emotional pain. Fast Break's mental health staff also responds to crises and disasters which have included school shootings, suicides, church fires, plane crashes, the terror attacks, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, accidental deaths and murders by providing mental health assessment, counseling, support and therapeutic childcare.</p>

			<h2 id="advocacy">Advocacy</h2>
			<p>Advocacy requires both the will to confront injustice and the commitment to transform it. ABC first championed the preservation of families when it developed the Luis Sanjurjo Day Care Center, a state-of-the-art early childhood program inside the most infamous, dangerous and squalid shelter, a "welfare" hotel called the Martinique. There, ABC/s daily "rescue missions" for children and families engaged it in the fight for daycare and housing for overwhelmed homeless families and ultimately led to the class action lawsuit, Grant v. Cuomo, which sought to provide preventive services to fragile families.</p>
